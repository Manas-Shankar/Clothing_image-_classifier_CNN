# Clothing_image-_classifier_CNN
A convolutional neural network designed to classify pictures of different pieces of clothing into one of ten classes:<br/>
['T-shirt/Top','Trouser','Pullover','Dress','Coat','Sandal','Shirt','Sneaker','Bag','Ankle Boot'].<br/>
Uses the 'fashionmnist' dataset from kaggle, with Keras and sklearn.<br/>
The model was trained on a GPU provided within the kaggle interactive environement, in ~15 minutes. Anyone wishing to reuse this notebook is recommended to do the same, as the CPU training time is well over 3 hours.
